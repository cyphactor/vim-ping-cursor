INTRODUCTION                                    *ping-cursor*

The Vim ping-cursor plugin is a plugin designed to help you quickly find your
cursor postion when you have lost it. This is especially useful when you are
in the middle of a task, are interrupted, and then have to find where you left
off. When the |ping-cursor-commands| is used it momentarily highlights the row
and column of the cursor so that you can easily see its location.

COMMANDS                                        *ping-cursor-commands*

                                                *ping-cursor-:PingCursor*
:PingCursor           Trigger a momentary highlight of the cursor location so
                      that it can be located 

MAPPINGS                                        *ping-cursor-mappings*

This plugin does not automatically define any mappings. However, we do
recommend the following mapping.

nnoremap <leader>p :PingCursor<cr>

The above mapping would make it so that <leader>p when pressed would execute
the :PingCursor command.

CONFIGURATION                                   *ping-cursor-configuration*

The duration of the cursor flash can be customized in your vimrc:

 " This is the default
 let g:ping_cursor_flash_milliseconds = 250
