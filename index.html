<h2>What it provides?</h2>

<p>This plugin provides a user-command called <code>PingCursor</code> which illuminates the
current location of the cursor temporarily so that you can easily find it.
Please see the <em>Configuration</em> section for details on how best to utilize the
<code>PingCursor</code> command.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen.vim</a> and using it in
combination with <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules">git
submodules</a> as describe in
this <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/">Vimcast - Synchronizing plugins with git submodules and
pathogen</a>.</p>

<p>If your installation method is the above recommended one, it should be as
simple as running the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.vim/
git submodule add git@github.com:cyphactor/vim-ping-cursor.git bundle/vim-ping-cursor
git add .
git commit -m "Added vim-ping-cursor plugin to my setup."
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using another method, you are on your own. I have been told that
this plugin is compatible with <a href="http://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a>
though I have not tested it myself.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The recommended configuration for this plugin is to simply map a key combo to
run the <code>PingCursor</code> command for you. This can easily be done by adding the
following to your <code>~/.vimrc</code>.</p>

<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;p :PingCursor&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example I map my normal mode <code>&lt;leader&gt;p</code> key combo to execute the
<code>PingCursor</code> command, in turn highlighting the current location of my cursor
momentarily.</p>

<p>You can of course map this command anyway you like, or even choose not to map
it and just execute the command as follows when you need it.</p>

<pre><code>:PingCursor&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Why I Built This</h2>

<h3>Initial Impetus</h3>

<p>Let me start out by explaining a scenario that happens to me at work on a
relatively regular basis. I often find myself working deep in the thicket of
code, when all of the sudden I am distracted by another co-worker asking a
question or simply making some noise. I found not being able to find my cursor
quickly frustrating.</p>

<h3>First Attempt</h3>

<p>So, I thought to myself, I wonder if <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> has cursor row
highlighting or possibly even cursor column highlighting. Sure enough
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> has both and enabling them was as simple as setting
the following in my <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>

<pre><code>set cursorline
set cursorcolumn
</code></pre>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>It turns out, the <code>cursorcolumn</code> option when enabled causes the full screen to
redraw. You might be thinking to yourself, that should not be a problem, I
have a very fast machine and it is just some text. I am sorry to inform you
that you are wrong.  It turns out that redrawing the full screen is quite
costly in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. More importently redrawing the full
screen interacts with lots of other features like <em>cursor movement</em>, <em>Ctrl-p
based completion</em>, and many others. This means that if you have cursor
highlighting on and use any of those features your <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
performance will tank during those operations.</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>The following are a number of threads, blogs, etc. where I found people
discussing this issue and trying to come up with work arounds for this issue.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/Vim-7-slows-down-when-highlighting-cursor-line-td1148280.html">http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/Vim-7-slows-down-when-highlighting-cursor-line-td1148280.html</a></li>

<li><a href="http://briancarper.net/blog/590/cursorcolumn--cursorline-slowdown">http://briancarper.net/blog/590/cursorcolumn--cursorline-slowdown</a></li>
</ul><p>After testing out a number of these work arounds I finally ended up deciding
to use the cursor pinging solution described in <a href="http://briancarper.net/blog/590/cursorcolumn--cursorline-slowdown">Brian Caprer's blog
post</a> and
create a <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> plugin so other people could easily obtain
this work around.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>Most of the credit here should go to Brian Carper because he provided a very
valuable <a href="http://briancarper.net/blog/590/cursorcolumn--cursorline-slowdown">blog
post</a> that
I used as the basis for this vim plugin.</p>

<p>Credit must also go out to all the others out there that struggled with this
issue as I did and dug in to <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> enough to understand
what was actually happening.</p>
